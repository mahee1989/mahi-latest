Hi team vv good mrng
all are good i think
today lohith on leave 
we have received 28 errors today
in this 28 we have to resolve all the errors
all managed servers we can configure for more error 
for more actual we can configure all the server related 
if any issue was not closed we can configure one error finding tool 
for more reasons we need to integrate all the samurai tools
we can do it through admin console heap parameters
exceptions should integrate itself more time is there need to update
need to do restart if any memory issues will come
all the errors should related for more accurate and sensible
for all the servers should enable it each responseble holder 
in all the mservers application should up on running 
if the application got struct or it went to abnormal state 
admin url should access with root user 
we can continue lets rehidrate things 
Hi team i taking break
