the ssl configures infront of the apache
in the 5 th server we need to configure template
if the server need to go give an application perfomance
new deployment we have to do
for more war files should install
we have to observe all the servers are up on running 
due to perfomance issue we can conclude any kind of issues 
need alternate perfomances for all the users in application
we have to provide the access to jenkins users 
if the users are provided for all the maintainable 
all the user names should itegrate it self 
you may continue for all the server side

it can contain each stage of the specification
most of the cases we can conclude all the perfomance issue
